# *Instrucions* #
$USER is a bash variable that contains your account's name

- Move lightconkyrc in /home/$USER/.conkyrc directory [mv lightconkyrc ~/.conkyrc ]
- Launch conky from /home/$USER [conky] or [conky .conkyrc]

# *Getting the script* #

CLI means "Command Line Interface"
- It is simple using Git CLI: "git clone https://github.com/StefanoBelli/LightConky"
- Getting latest version - from LightConky directory: "git pull"
- Ubuntu font is needed: Arch Linux User can get it by package communtiy/ttf-ubuntu-font-family
- hddtemp is needed to show Disk temperature (Celsius)
What else? Ah...
You need to launch hddtemp daemon to see Disk temperature, else Conky says that hddtemp is not reachable, this because server is not launched and running.
To launch hddtemp daemon:

$ su -c "hddtemp -d /dev/device" 
or
$ sudo hddtemp -d /dev/device
or
# hddtemp -d /dev/device

Where $ is any user except root, and # is root, you don't need to include # or $ ; device is a device such as sda, sdb, sdc, sdd, and more... this should be your hard drive (dev device)

# *Developer* #
I remind you that I am NOT original developer, this was an old script 
(http://crunchbang.org/forums/viewtopic.php?pid=45168#p45168), I improved this. This is my first Conky script :)
